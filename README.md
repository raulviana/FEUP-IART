# FEUP-IART

Repository for the Artificial Intelligence [(**IART**)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436449) course

## Assigment 1

In the first assignment, we solved [2019's google hashcode qualification round - photo slideshow](https://github.com/raulviana/FEUP-IART/blob/master/Assigment1/assets/hashcode2019_qualification_task.pdf), modulating it has a search problem, and exploring several different search approaches and algorithms.
We used **Hill Climbing**, **Simulated Annealing** and **Genetic Algorithms**.
We also developed a UI, to simplify the comparing of the different approaches.

## Assigment 2

In the second assignment, we used a football dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) and we tried to fit some models to it to predict the outcomes of its games. 
We used the jupyter notebook, and printed an [*hml* version](https://github.com/raulviana/FEUP-IART/blob/master/Assigment2/delivery/IART-MachineLearning.html) of it.
