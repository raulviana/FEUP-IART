Repository for the Artificial Intelligence [(**IART**)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436449) course

## Assigment 1

In the first assignment, we solved 2019's google hashcode qualification round - photo slideshow, modulating it has a search problem, and exploring several different search approaches and algorithms.
We used Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms.

## Assigment 2

In the second assignment, we used a football dataset from Kaggle and we tried to fit some models to it to predict the outcomes of its games. 
We used the jupyter notebook, and printed an [*hml* version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wg-6s5hI-t8N7a6mYwMWgCZvj377S4ez/view?usp=sharing) of it.
